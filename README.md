### Hi there 👋

I am a self-motivated individual who is passionate about the environment and sustainable development, may it be in business or sports etc., which I believe can be achieved with the aid of informed decision making through data analytics and visualization. 

I enjoy learning new skills and hacks, and open-source community and forums that provides a wealth of knowledge. No wonder I ❤️ Github...a go to tool for learning and skill enhancement. Hit me up up with any new information that may enhance my skills 📖

I enjoy	🏊‍ 🏃‍ 🥾 and I secretly hate 🍫...🤫 none of my friends know😃.... Enjoy sports...⚽	💯 HALA MADRID!!
